This script is part of the MLOps / Model Governance phase:

üîÑ ML Lifecycle Stage: Post-training / Model Registration
Stage	                     Description
‚úîÔ∏è Training Completed	    Model is already trained, tested, and saved to S3
‚úîÔ∏è Ready for Deployment	    Now it's time to package and version the model
‚úÖ Model Registry Phase	   Register the model so it can be tracked, approved, or deployed

Purpose of register_model.py
This script registers a trained model in Amazon SageMaker Model Registry by:
-   Creating (if not already created) a Model Package Group
-   Packaging the trained model as a versioned model entry in that group
-   Setting it to a pending approval state so it can be reviewed and deployed through MLOps pipelines
