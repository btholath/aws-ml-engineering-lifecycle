## üè• Scenario 1 ‚Äì Real-Time Medical Imaging Triage

**Use Case**: A hospital network runs deep learning models to analyze X-ray and MRI images in real time, prioritizing urgent cases.

- **Challenge**: Scan volume peaks during business hours and drops significantly at night.
- **Solution**: Configure SageMaker real-time endpoints with target tracking based on `ConcurrentRequestsPerModel`.

```python
predictor = model.deploy(
    instance_type='ml.g5.xlarge',
    endpoint_name='medical-imaging-endpoint',
    endpoint_auto_scaling=True
)
