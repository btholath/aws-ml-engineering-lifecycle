- Verify Feature Group via AWS CLI

aws sagemaker describe-feature-group --feature-group-name loan-approval-feature-group


--------------------------------------------
Here are the steps to use SageMaker Feature Store
- Create a feature group
    - define schema and attributes
        - requires a unique identifier and a timestamp
- Ingest data into a featured groups
- Access the store to retrieve features for datasets.
    - Use PutRecord API to insert data
    - Batch ingestion with AWS Glue or Lambda
    - Validate data integrity during ingestion to prevent corrupt records.
    - Use automated retries for failed ingestio  attempts to ensure reliability.
- Accessing features
    - Query online store for low-latency Access
    - Use offline store for analyltics with Athena.
    - Build training datasets using features

Storage
Type       Description
online     Designed for low-latency, real-time access to feature data.
           Stored in a high-performance database managed by sagemaker. (DynamoDB)
           Real-time Inference

offline    Designed for batch processing, historical data anlaysis, and feature engineering.
           Persistently stored in S3.
           Model training & batch inference

Online and Offline  - Combination of both
